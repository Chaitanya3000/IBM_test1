    <h3>Malnutrition</h3>
    <p>
      Malnutrition is a health condition resulting from an insufficient or
      imbalanced intake of essential nutrients. It can lead to various health
      problems and hinder proper growth and development. Malnutrition can be
      caused by factors such as poor dietary choices, limited access to
      nutritious foods, inadequate healthcare, and socioeconomic challenges. It
      encompasses both undernutrition, where there's a deficiency of vital
      nutrients, and overnutrition, which involves excessive calorie intake
      without adequate nutrition. Malnutrition has far-reaching consequences on
      physical health, cognitive function, and immune response, impacting
      individuals and communities worldwide. Efforts to address malnutrition
      involve strategies to improve nutrition education, increase access to
      healthy foods, and enhance healthcare systems to ensure better overall
      well-being.
